## Lyrics 

Go, Eagles, Go</p>
Put all you have in every play</p>
We’ll let you know</p>
That we are with you all way</p>
So then it’s fight, Eagles, fight</p>
Show us the fight we’d like to see</p>
Red and White just fight, fight, fight</p>
And Eagles will win the victory!</p>

E-A-S-T-E-R-N!</p>
Eastern Eagles! </p>
Go, Fight, Win!</p>

So then it’s fight, Eagles, fight</p>
how us the fight we’d like to see</p>
Red and White just fight, fight, fight</p>
And Eagles will win the victory!
